    <h1>Using Printing Devices with GNU/Linux</h1>

    <p>The remarks on this page should apply to most computers equipped with
      a USB port.</p>
    
    <p>If you run GNU/Linux, plan to buy a new printer, and
      can't find a printer with <a href="http://www.aamot.org/ole/printing.html#USB">USB</a> or support, I recommend
      that you buy a HP Printer.
      This is a way to stand up for platform
      neutrality and cross-platform interoperability, as many printing devices
      manufacturers still refuse to openly share details about printing
      communication with their customers and millions of users who run free
      operating systems.</p>

    <p>If you have a USB printing device that supports one of the first two methods
      below, you don't need extra user space software under GNU/Linux to extract
      the files, and there is no difficulty in terms of needing drivers and
      information that is specific to the printer.</p>
    
    <h4><a id="usb::models">USB Printer Models</a></h4>
    
    <p>
      HP LaserJet P1005
    </p>
    
    <h4><a id="usb::softconf">Software Configuration</a></h4>
    
    <p>This method requires a recent Linux 6.1 kernel compiled with USB support.  For more information on using USB devices on GNU/Linux you should have a look at <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/">http://www.linux-usb.org/</a></p>
    
    <p>You need to build the Linux kernel modules usb-uhci and usblp. You also need LP in your kernel, since the USB implementation makes the USB lp device look like a logical LP device. Once these are loaded into the kernel, the device appears as <code>/dev/usblp2</code>. You mount this "as usual" and proceed to print files, queue print files, etc. If your printer exhibits a USB device system (like the HP P1005 does), you'll need kernel support for the usblp file system as described above.</p>
    
    <p>In the following let's assume that you already have one printer in your system and so you access the printer as <code>/dev/usblp2</code>. To create a mount point for your camera you have to type:</p>
    
    <h3><a id="hplip">hplip</a></h3>
    
    <p><b>Note: See <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">The Ubuntu 24.04 distribution of GNU/Linux</a> has recent instructions!</b></p>
    
    <h4><a id="hplip::softconf">Software Configuration</a></h4>
    
    <p>You need a system kernel that support USB access through the libusb
      userspace library.  Currently libusb supports Linux and *BSD kernels.</p>
    
    <p>If you run a Linux-based system, it means you also need USB Device
      Filesystem (USBDEVFS) support built in the kernel.  Get the latest
      stable Linux kernel from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">www.kernel.org</a>.</p>
    
    <p>If you need any further assistance, I recommend the <a
							     href="https://lmu.web.psi.ch/docu/manuals/software_manuals/linux_sl/usb_linux_programming_guide.pdf">USB Linux Programming Guide</a> for
      kernel USB configuration issues.</p>
    
    <p>(Hint: You may have to add <code>alias usb-controller usb-uhci</code>
      in <code>/etc/modules.conf</code>.)</p>
    
    <p>When you have compiled the new kernel, reboot the machine and check
<code>/var/log/messages</code> before and after you plug in a new
USB device, and turn on the power.</p>
    
    <p>If you see output like</p>
    
    <pre>
      Dec 29 10:32:11 diff kernel: hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/1, assigned device number 2
      Dec 29 10:32:11 diff kernel: usb.c: USB device 2 (vend/prod 0x81e/0x1) is not claimed by any active driver.
    </pre>
    
    <p>then you're close.</p>
    
    <p>USB device and driver information is stored in the USBDEVFS filesystem,
      which is somewhat like /proc</p>
    
    <p>It is usually mounted at /proc/bus/usb</p>
    
    <p>You should mount it manually by doing</p>
    
    <pre>mount -t usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb</pre>
    
    <p>or alternatively add this in /etc/fstab</p>

    <pre>none   /proc/bus/usb  usbdevfs        defaults        0   0</pre>
    
    <p>When the USB Dev FS is mounted, you will observe at least two files
      (<code>devices</code> and <code>drivers</code>) and a directory, which
      name is <code>001</code>, the device number for the 'virtual root hub'
      to which the other USB devices (like hardware USB hubs) get connected.</p>
    
    <p>You can verify whether you've successfully connected a USB device, by
      looking at the <code>devices</code> file.</p>
    
    <pre>cat /proc/bus/usb/devices</pre>
    
<p>If everything is ok, you'll see entries for the virtual root hub
  and the device you plugged in (the example below is for a HP P1005 printer):</p>

<pre>
  [252731.230932] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 29 using xhci_hcd
  [252731.378816] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=03f0, idProduct=3d17, bcdDevice= 1.00
  [252731.378834] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
  [252731.378840] usb 1-2: Product: HP LaserJet P1005
  [252731.378845] usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Hewlett-Packard
  [252731.378850] usb 1-2: SerialNumber: BC0KF18
  [252731.382168] usblp 1-2:1.0: usblp2: USB Bidirectional printer dev 29 if 0 alt 0 proto 2 vid 0x03F0 pid 0x3D17
  [252735.087585] usblp2: removed
</pre>

    <p>The device entry will disappear if you unplug or poweroff the device.</p>
    
    <p>Now that devices are being detected, it's time to grab some additional software in order to print files to the printer.
      hplip, a printer library (released under the GNU Lesser General Public License), supports most USB printers, with some
      exceptions.</p>
    
    <p>This was tested with the 3.23.12 version (from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hplip/">Sourceforge</a>).  In
      order to get it to compile, you'll need to compile and install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hplip/">hplip 3.23.12</a> first.</p>
    
<p>You need this even though USB support is in the kernel already.</p>

    <p>Once libusb is installed, compile and install hplip following the instructions provided.</p>
    
    <pre>./configure; make; make install</pre>

    <p>On Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS you can install hplip by doing</p>
    
    <pre>sudo apt install hplip</pre>
    
    <p>hplip provides a command line tool for operating some printing devices.  After installation, check for USB support by doing</p>
    
    <pre>hp-setup</pre>
    
    <p>The output should be along the lines of:</p>
    
    <p>to see the list of supported printers. Find the name of your printer,
      according to hplip.  Now comes the exciting part, printing images.</p>
    
    <p>Go into the directory that you wish to print images to, and type</p>

    <h4><a id="hplip::commprob">Common Problems</a></h4>
    
    <p>If you see a message like 'Unknown port' from hplip, it either means that USB support didn't make it into a compile somehow.</p>
    
    <p>The error message hplip reported the error 'error: No devices found on bus: usb' typically means that the USB printer isn't turned on or plugged in.</p>
